        <p> Greta Thunberg was born in Sweden in January 2003. When she was 11 years old, she found out about climate change and its foreseen impact on the Earth. This caused a great amount of stress for her, sending her into a depression for multiple years. She was also diagnosed with mutism, only speaking when she finds it necessary. She made that aspect of herself a leading statement in her first speech, emphasizing the importance in taking action against climate change. She has sacrificed her education in order to spread awareness about the crisis of climate change. Thunberg has taken a year off of her school in Stockholm to fight for this cause that she feels extremely passionate about.</p>
        <p>Greta Thunberg began taking action in 2018, making school strikes to address the cause. She also became prominent on social media, uploading photos of her own personal protesting. This led to her getting a lot of attention from the press, becoming recognized as a professional and qualified climate activist. During this time, she would be brought onto news outlets such as “Democracy Now!” at which she stated that she gained inspiration from school strikes centered around recent shootings, using that as a basis for her work. After the start of the covid pandemic, she has been somewhat unable to lead large group protests. Despite that fact, she continues to push forward her ideas through social media, primarily Instagram and Twitter. Most recently, she is in the process of creating a petition to declare a “climate emergency” to the United Nations in an attempt to spread awareness.</p>
        <p>By calling attention to climate change, the issue has become more of a talking point across the world. While her words have brought it to the attention of the masses, as of the present, no action has been taken by any world government to address it. She was at her height in 2019, which had held one of the biggest climate protests in New York City. She has caused people to take a call to action and despite being for the most part ignored by those in power, she continues to fight for her cause.</p>
