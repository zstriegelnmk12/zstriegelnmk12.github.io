                <q>
                    "My message is that we'll be watching you.
                    "This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you!
                    "You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.

                <i>Section #2:</i>
                <q>
                We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you!
                "For more than 30 years, the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you're doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight.
                "You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I do not want to believe that. Because if you really understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And that I refuse to believe.
                </q>

                <q>
                "The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5 degrees [Celsius], and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control.
                "Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.
                "So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us — we who have to live with the consequences.
                "To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5 degrees global temperature rise – the best odds given by the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] – the world had 420 gigatons of CO2 left to emit back on Jan. 1st, 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatons.

            <p class="speech">
                <i>Section #4:</i>
                "How dare you pretend that this can be solved with just 'business as usual' and some technical solutions? With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years.
                "There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures here today, because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is.
                "You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us, I say: We will never forgive you.
                "We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.
                "Thank you."

            <!-- Left annotate (SAY) -->
            <p class="say">
                (It isn’t the role of the younger generation to solve all climate change issues but due to the failed attempts of the adult-generation it is robbing kids of their generation and forcing them to solve the problem by themselves)
                (Climate change is real, and it’s happening now)
                (This is an urgent situation and its been thrown upon the youth to solve it)
            </p>
            
            <p class="say">
                Due to adult’s obsession with money they settle with our current situation and say that you understand the circumstances but you are just remaining inactive. 
                The people leading our world have ignored real issues facing ourselves, and continue to ignore the inevitable
                They are too focused on issues that do not matter as much. They fail to understand the urgency.
            </p>
            
            <p class="say">
                It's not fair to just throw the issue onto the future generation just because it won't affect you. This isn't a simple issue, it must be resolved in a fast manner because not much time is left.
                A usage of facts is there to put emphasis on the impending issue of climate change and that time is running out and the buil-up of this issue will reach a level where it is unsolvable
                Everyday that we don’t take action, our chances of success become slimmer and slimmer.
            </p>
            
            <p class="say">
                We are running out of time.
                You refuse to accept the truth and possible consequences.
                You are and continue to be the reason for these issues.
                If you aren’t going to help, we’ll do it ourselves.
                Thunberg is cleary blaming the older generation for not being active and has now decided to take matters in her own hand despite it not being her job because time is simply running out
            </p>
            
            <!-- Right annotate (DO) -->
            
            <p class="do">
                Tone -  threatening, incriminating and deceived
                Repetition - “I should” 
                This shouldn't be her problem to solve
                Repetition - “you” - to emphasize the distinction in groups
                Emphasis - “Entire” paints a bigger picture to base her argument on
                Pathos- appeal to emotion by mentioning the people dying and their devastated ecosystems
            </p>
            
            <p class="do">
                Again the emphasis on “we” and “you” showing a separation
                Antagonizes them for having different priorities
                Repetition: how dare you
                They do not do anything to solve this
                Logos is used to express how action is not being taken
                Use of facts to emphasize logos/ logic
                Tone: disappointed, urgent and reprimanding
                Repetition of “you” which is insinuating an accusing tone
            </p>
            
            <p class="do">
                Use of logos
                Tone- Use of “may be acceptable to you” emphasizes a sense that audience doesn’t care/ acknowledge her claims
                Tone- reproach and also separation between “me” and “you”
                Pointing out the
                incapability of authoritative figures
                Logos- “67%” chance emphasizes that we only have so much time to change our ways.
                An exaggeration was made to put emphasis on the issue
                Shows authoritative figures lack of care for the issue
                Again, those facts are there to put emphasis on the impending crisis that is occuring
                Shows urgency of the situation and how little time is left
            </p>
            
            <p class="do">
                A repetition as stated in the earlier paragraphs 
                We don't have the resources to to put a proper plan into action
                Tone: reproachful
                Uses logos in order to demonstrate knowledge on situation
                The issue is something that the generation before must solve themselves
                A clear division between younger generations and older ones with the “We” and “you”
                Repetition of saying “We” is used as a way to express opposition
                “Right here, Right now” shows the urgency regarding time
                A repetition of failing shows how disappointed she feels
                Uses pathos to make politicians look like the enemy/ at fault
                Ethos: We have the power to change the world for the better, you are either with or against us
