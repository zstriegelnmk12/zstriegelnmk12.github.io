                Greta Thunberg is a climate activist who has become a prominent figure in the cause in 2016. Her audience in this speech is representatives of the UN. She is making her speech at the UN Climate Action Summit, an event held in order to address the effects of climate change and possible solutions. The issue of climate change has been building up for many years and is a severe threat to our life on earth due to the ever growing pollution created by humans. Throughout her speech she creates a sense of urgency regarding the crisis of climate change by using repetition, pathos, and logos in order to make her intended audience realize their lack of actions. She clearly implies that due to this inactivity it is now in the hands of the younger generation to fight for their earth which they will do despite the inconveniences that come with it.

                During the first chunk of Greta Thunbergs’s speech she uses a combination of Pathos, a deceived tone and repetition in order to convey the urgency that revolves around the problem of climate change. There had been a significant increase in carbon emissions thus triggering many protests to be established, a popular one being school sit-outs, where students would leave their classes to make a statement. Throughout her speech Thunberg references these school sit-outs by saying that she “should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.” But since adults “all come to” ask “young people for hope,” she is unable to get a stable education. Thunberg establishes a tone of disappointment when regarding the older audience of model UN leaders because as adults they are expected to be responsive to conflict and to use their skills and resources to better society. However their inactivity has forced a younger generation to take over and fight for their future. Said leaders have said that they deemed their actions to be “enough” to fight climate change but when regarding the “urgency” of the issue it is not “enough.” In societal norms, children should not be expected to sacrifice their “childhood” and “dreams” in order to prevent “entire ecosystems” from collapsing. She further emphasizes a reproachful tone towards the generation of adults by using a repetition of “How dare you.” This allows for the purpose of her speech to be clear, how could full grown adults with the necessary resources and power be satisfied with an accumulating global crisis and “how dare” they rely on a younger generation of kids to solve the problem. Throughout her speech she references the negative impact of climate change on various ecosystems and populations throughout the world in order to invoke pathos in her audience. She manages to mix in her usage of repetition while saying that “people are suffering, people are dying” in order to emphasize her appeal to emotion. This allows for the intended audience to feel culpability for their lack of actions and is a form of guilt-tripping to make them realize that calling for the younger generation's aid is wrong.  All in all, these various techniques are there to establish a stressor on the growing issue of climate change in order to incite a reaction in the intended audience.

                The second third of Thunberg’s speech focuses on the usage of Logos and some Pathos to show how the older generation doesn't do enough about global warming and keeps a tone of disappointment. One example of Pathos can be seen when she states “We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth.” She reveals her disappointment in the older generation by pointing out that they seem to care more about marginal problems rather than the mass extinction of species on earth. By doing this, she establishes the fact that people seem to think this problem aligns with other modern issues, when clearly it holds much more importance than it is perceived as. At this point Thunberg utilizes Logos to prove her point, and casts doubt of credibility amongst the people who actually can do something about this. She begins by saying “Fifty percent may be acceptable to you. But those numbers do not include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of equity and climate justice. They also rely on my generation sucking hundreds of billions of tons of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist.” Then she utilizes pathos to say “So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us — we who have to live with the consequences.” The usage of Pathos comes into play because people view percentages in different ways, and when she states the percentage risk, she explains that this number may be acceptable for the older generation, but for us it is not because we will have to be the ones living in that future. This shows how the adults do not care much for the issue, and that they think this should be up to the new generation since they'll most likely be gone by then.

                In the last third of her speech, Thunberg uses a combination of logos and pathos, as well as ethos. She uses these strategies in order to expose the real threat of climate change as well as how her audience (the United Nations) haven’t done anything to help aid in the crisis and are merely pretending to take accountability. In the beginning of this section, she states that the “remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone within less than 8 1/2 years,” enforcing the idea that we don’t have much time left. This use of logic not only uses facts, but these facts also bring forth a sense of sadness or despair, a strong use of pathos. While she combines these two MoD in tandem with one another, she saves her use of ethos for the end of the speech when addressing her audience. This is evident when she states how the government is “failing us,” and how the “the young people are starting to understand [the government’s] betrayal.” She is addressing her audience as the villains in this scenario, while at the same time saying that her generation “will not let [them] get away with this.”

                Through her whole speech, Thunburg utilizes Pathos, Ethos and Logos to highlight the irresponsibility of the representatives of the UN Climate Action Summit. The goal of her speech was to not only call out the representatives for not taking proper action, but to also make the problem of global warming more apparent, so that more funding and a proper plan can come into play that does not solely rely on pure chance and the future generation.
