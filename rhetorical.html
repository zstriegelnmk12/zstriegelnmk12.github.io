        <p>The U.N. Climate Action Summit, An event held annually where different speakers talk about issues revolving around Climate Change. In 2019, Greta Thunberg was one of the people who spoke at the event, she stood out due to her young age, and thus was representing the youth of this generation. She spoke out to various world leaders, her objective being to ridicule the people in front of her, and other powerful people who were listening on how they are callous and slothful when creating “solutions” to Climate Change. She talks about how they need to be more diligent in their work, because this issue is complex, and thus requires a complex solution. </p>
        <p>Climate change has been a recurring issue that has been growing in intensity over the past years. Sea levels have been rising and oceans have been growing warmer at a rate like never seen before. The increased amount of pollution that humans are emitting on a daily basis is seriously damaging our health. Due to this growing issue an immediate response would’ve been necessary to slow down the fast-pacing spread of climate change but governments and various political leaders have not been efficient enough. </p>
        <p>Climate Change is still a current issue to this day that is a clear menace to our survival on this planet. Due to the inability of adults to find a solution to this problem it has obligated the younger generation to fight for their future on this planet. Greta Thunberg is a perfect example of  a member of the younger generation who has made it her duty to fight for this cause. She has done that by reaching out to political leaders who have the power and influence to make a change globally in order to advance towards her goals. “In 2019, Thunberg sailed across the Atlantic on a yacht to attend a UN climate conference in New York”, stated bbc news. While there, she delivered the speech that we are studying today in order to share her thoughts to influential people. Thunberg’s opinion on the various policies regarding climate changes with goals for the years of 2030 and 2050 are rather pessimistic, instead she urges people to act now and to make goals for today. All in all, her main goal is to fight climate change as soon as possible due to the stress of time running out.</p>
